What started as an unexpected layoff led to self-doubt, job hunting struggles, and eventually a move to a new city. But sometimes taking that leap—even when it means temporary separation from loved ones—opens doors we never knew existed.</em></p><h2 id=the-unexpected-news>The Unexpected News</h2><p>I still remember when my CTO chatted with me on Slack on what seemed like a usual working day. He said &ldquo;Do you have time? I need to talk with you.&rdquo; With so many stories about tech layoffs in the news, it was hard not to overthink it—maybe this was my last day at the company. And what I was overthinking was really happening.</p><p>That day he explained they needed to do some layoffs and restructuring to keep the company afloat. He was clear that nothing was wrong with my work—in fact, I was doing great. Even with that reassurance, the news still shocked me. As a husband and dog owner, I needed to start thinking about how to keep my family afloat too.</p><p>On my last day at the company, I said goodbye to my colleagues. Even though I had only met the CEO in person, I really enjoyed working with the team. Despite being separated by countries (continents even), we had worked together efficiently and built something meaningful.</p><h2 id=the-job-hunt-begins>The Job Hunt Begins</h2><p>After that came my time to look for a new job. My daily routine became studying LeetCode problems, watching system design videos, and updating my CV. Thanks to my lovely wife, she helped format my CV properly—if it were up to me, I would have just exported it straight from LinkedIn. I also started applying sporadically on LinkedIn to any jobs that matched my skillset.</p><p>For the first month, I focused exclusively on companies offering remote work. I had just married and my wife had recently started working in our current city, so staying put seemed like the right choice. I applied through LinkedIn, reached out to friends and former colleagues, trying to uncover new opportunities wherever I could find them.</p><h2 id=the-interview-rollercoaster>The Interview Rollercoaster</h2><p>Finally, after applying to many places, I landed 2 interviews with companies that offered remote work. Both had similar processes: coding tests followed by product/system design tests. However, I failed at the product tests. Even though it stung, I made sure to ask each recruiter for feedback on what went wrong and how I could improve. Fortunately, all the recruiters were genuinely helpful and provided valuable insights.</p><p>But with multiple failed interviews piling up, I started doubting myself. I kept grinding through LeetCode problems and system design concepts, but couldn&rsquo;t shake the doubt. <em>Is this really worth it? Maybe software engineers aren&rsquo;t needed anymore since AI can do the work now—should I just start farming in the countryside? Am I really a &ldquo;senior software engineer&rdquo; or did I just get that title by some fluke?</em></p><h2 id=expanding-the-search>Expanding the Search</h2><p>When remote opportunities dried up, I decided to also apply to companies requiring full Working From Office (WFO). Since there were no big tech companies in my city, my options were limited. Considering the possibility of moving to another city, I reached out to friends again to see if their companies had any openings.</p><p>This led to 2 more interviews—one through a friend in the community, and another via LinkedIn. My friend&rsquo;s company had a simple take-home test: create a single mobile page using any technology. With the time limit in mind and my expertise in .NET MAUI, I decided to stick with what I knew best. The other interview followed the familiar pattern: coding test followed by system design. Once again, I failed the system design portion, and the self-doubt crept back in.</p><h2 id=the-silver-lining>The Silver Lining</h2><p>Fortunately, the opportunity from my friend progressed to the offer stage. After some negotiations, I decided to accept the position.</p><p>And here I am now, two months into my probation period, working in Jakarta, temporarily separated from my wife, and commuting to the office daily. Even though I used to dread the idea of working in Jakarta because of the notorious traffic, it&rsquo;s actually not as bad as I expected. Jakarta now has many public transportation options that make commuting both cheaper and faster. My daily commute is only about 20 minutes and costs just 6,000 Rupiah—pretty reasonable by any standard.</p><p>Jakarta also offers many more attractions and interesting places compared to Malang, though I do miss the fresh air back home.</p><h2 id=looking-forward>Looking Forward</h2><p>Sometimes life takes us on unexpected detours. What began as a shocking layoff evolved into a period of self-reflection, skill-building, and ultimately led to new opportunities in a vibrant city. While the temporary separation from my wife isn&rsquo;t ideal, this experience has taught me that taking calculated risks—even uncomfortable ones—can open doors we never knew existed.</p><p>The job search wasn&rsquo;t easy, and the self-doubt was real. But persistence, the support of loved ones, and staying open to new possibilities made all the difference. Sometimes the path forward isn&rsquo;t what we initially planned, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the wrong path.</p></div><div class=post__footer><span><a class=tag href=/en/tags/work/>work</a><a class=tag href=/en/tags/life/>life</a></span></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer__base"><ul class=footer__list><li class=footer__item>&copy;
